        <p>Welcome to my personal website / portfolio. I'm <b>Samantha</b> and I'm currently a Cyber Operating Systems Security Researcher at MITRE Corporation. I studied <b>Computer Science, Computer Security, and Embedded System Design</b> for both my masters and bachelors degrees at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. This page is dedicated to the projects I do in my free time. From cooking to painting, and even coding (...sometimes) I like to keep myself on my toes learning new things! This site is my way of sharing and accessing these projects.</p>
