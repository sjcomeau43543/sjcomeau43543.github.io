  <h2> Using Data Visualisation to Communicate the Sources of Plastic Pollutants in Port Phillip Bay </h2>
  <p> Plastic pollution is a complex problem. The chemical properties of plastic make it a threat to marine biodiversity when it is 
    improperly disposed of. This project assists the Port Phillip EcoCentre, which has been conducting litter audits across streets, 
    beaches, and rivers in order to determine levels of plastic pollution in Port Phillip Bayâ€™s catchment area. This project compiled 
    litter audit, human, and environmental data into a Geographic Information Systems map to visualise the data, facilitate its analysis, 
    and enable communication with the public and government. The visualisation was analysed for correlation between pollution levels 
    and factors which will impact waste management policies and source reduction plans on the local and state level. </p>
