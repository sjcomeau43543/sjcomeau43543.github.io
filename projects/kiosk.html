  <h2> Hospital Kiosk </h2>
  <h3> Description </h3>
  <p> Software Engineering is a course at WPI that focuses on building Computer Science students' teamwork skills while teaching them 
    Agile software development techniques. Our team had 8 people on them and my role within this team was Lead Software Engineer, 
    which means I coordinated tasks with the other software engineers, performed code reviews, assisted with training other team members, 
    and took responsibility for any loose ends that may need to be fixed for deliverables. Alongside these responsibilities, I also 
    lead and scheduled Scrum meetings and set weekly goals for our team's sprints. Our team was the winning team during our section of 
    Software Engineering, meaning we produced the best navigation kiosk application for a hospital in the opinion of the professor, TA's,
    and employees from the hospital. </p>
