  <p> The purpose of this work was to research the current state of the art in safety technology. The goal was to evaluate the existing technologies and determine the benefits and downfalls of implemented technologies. To do this, all the technologies were researched and critically examined. The technologies were then categorized by audience, technology and available features. This research found an underwhelming state of the art and provided recommendations moving forward for improvements on the various technologies.  </p>
