  <h1 class="header">Using Data Visualisation to Communicate the Sources of Plastic Pollutants in Port Phillip Bay</h1>
  <h2 class="header2">DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p> This was a part of WPI's Interactive Qualifying Project, a project where students work with people from different background in a 
    different country to conduct research in a field that is typically different than the student's degree. For this project, I worked with
    a team of four students and we travelled to Melbourne, Australia to support the Port Phillip EcoCentre, an organization dedicated 
    to making a meaningful impact on the environment through their research. One project they are funded for is the Clean Bay Blueprint 
    which focuses on the transport and impact that plastic pollutants have on Port Phillip Bay. </p>
  <h2 class="header2">ABSTRACT</h2>
  <p> Plastic pollution is a complex problem. The chemical properties of plastic make it a threat to marine biodiversity when it is 
    improperly disposed of. This project assists the Port Phillip EcoCentre, which has been conducting litter audits across streets, 
    beaches, and rivers in order to determine levels of plastic pollution in Port Phillip Bayâ€™s catchment area. This project compiled 
    litter audit, human, and environmental data into a Geographic Information Systems map to visualise the data, facilitate its analysis, 
    and enable communication with the public and government. The visualisation was analysed for correlation between pollution levels 
    and factors which will impact waste management policies and source reduction plans on the local and state level. </p>
